| Strength  | **Scavenging** | Scavenge for supplies, strategize against threats |

| Divine Anarchy   | The apocalypse is proof that the gods have fallen and their divine power has been ceded. Those bold enough to venture to ground zero shall be able to claim the divine power for themselves and shape the new world by their hand.                                       |

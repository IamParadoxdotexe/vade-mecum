Scavengers honorably risk life and limb to bring back vital resources to those that depend on them, showing courage in the midst of desolation.

| Attribute | Skill          | Description                                       |
| --------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Strength  | **Scavenging** | Scavenge for supplies, strategize against threats |

## Scribe

Scribes are the custodians of history, piecing together the fragmented past to guide the present and inspire the future.
They use their deep intelligence and insatiable curiosity to decipher the ways of the old world, unlocking technologies, philosophies, and strategies from a bygone era.
Scribes are invaluable advisors for their ability to solve complex problems and lay the foundation of the new world.

## Mutant

Mutants are survivors twisted and reshaped by the wasteland, bearing grotesque alterations that imbue them with abilities as fearsome as their appearances.
Using the chaotic energy of their mutations, they defy the laws of nature to withstand the harsh realities of the deep wastes.
Mutants are shunned and feared by the unmutated, forcing them to live on the fringes of what remains of society and band together for survival.

## Believer

Believers are charismatic zealots, drawing the desperate and hopeful into their fold with promises of salvation and renewal.

Believers rely on unpredictable signs and portents to guide their journey, often letting their unwavering belief blind them to pragmatic concerns.

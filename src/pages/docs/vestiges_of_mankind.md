## Scavenger

Scavengers are resilient and resourceful survivors that are a constant lifeline to those they provide for.
With their knowledge of the wasteland's dangers and their prowess in combat against them, they have an unparalleled ability to unearth supplies in ruins others dare not tread.
Scavengers honorably risk life and limb to bring back vital resources to those that depend on them, showing courage in the midst of desolation.

| Attribute | Skill          | Description                                       |
| --------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Strength  | **Scavenging** | Scavenge for supplies, strategize against threats |

### Class Item

Every Scavenger carries a Survival Handbook that they use to record the creatures and locations they have encountered to aid them in Scavenging.
This piece of gear is commonly a notebook from the old world or a hand-crafted journal made from scrap stationary.

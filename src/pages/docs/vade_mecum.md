# 1. World

The most important part of every RPG is its world. It's what gives the characters life and the adventures meaning.
By design, _Vade Mecum_ is world-agnostic, meaning it is built to work in any universe with any theme in any time period.

Does this mean we hang you out to dry when it comes to designing your World? Of course not!

_Vade Mecum_ provides a number of pre-built "World Kits" that will provide the resources you need to start adventuring.
This includes everything from weapons and armor, places and people, and adventuring classes.
We will highlight some of these kits below, but their complete documentation can be found in the kit itself.

# 2. Characters

A character is a sentient creature that exists in the World to work towards its goals, uphold its ideals, and above all else, survive.
Characters are chiefly defined by attributes, skills, and perks, all of which are deciding factors in just how well it performs at completing those objectives.

> Player characters, or PC's, are characters controlled by the players.
> Non-player characters, or NPC's, are characters controlled by the Game Master.

## 2.1 Attributes

Each character has 5 core attributes that define its physical and mental ability.
These attributes are scored on a scale from 1 to 6, with the average human being a 3.
When a character performs an action, these attribute scores are used to determine how well they do.

| Attribute        | Description                                              |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Strength**     | Measures athletics, endurance, and muscular power.       |
| **Dexterity**    | Measures agility, reflexes, and coordination.            |
| **Intelligence** | Measures critical thinking, problem solving, and memory. |
| **Charisma**     | Measures empathy, persuasiveness, and social influence.  |
| **Perception**   | Measures awareness, attention, and insightfulness.       |

Within the 5 attributes, each character has one Flaw and one Focus.
A character's Flaw is their glaring weakness—the quality that holds them back from being the perfect adventurer.
And oppositely, a character's Focus is their greatest power—the quality that makes them a master of their class.

## 2.2 Skills

Below attributes, characters have 15 core skills that represent proficiencies within a specific attribute area.
These skills are scored on a scale from 0 to 3, with the average human being a 1.
Skills allow characters to specialize themselves for specific types of actions.

| Attribute    | Skill             | Description                                                  |

## 2.3 Perks

From skills, characters can adopt perks that serve as an expansion of their overall abilities.
Each perk falls under a specific skill and will require a minimum level in that skill to acquire.
As such, perks give characters a way to accentuate their strengths in ways that compliment their play style.

| Perception   |                  | Investigation 3 |                                                                                                       |

## 2.4 Classes

While attributes, skills, and perks are the foundation of a character's abilities, classes are the foundation of a character's identity and nature.
Classes define a character's Focus attribute, as well as gives them access to skills, perks, and items that are otherwise inaccessible to other classes.

> Specific character classes are defined by the World Kit being used, but all classes follow a universal pattern for how they are structured.

Classes grant a character a unique 16th skill that falls under the designated Focus attribute.
This class skill is used to perform class-specific actions and give the character an edge in a specialized area of the World.

Each class provides a unique list of perks that fall under this class skill.
These class perks will often allow the character to evolve its abilities in different ways.

Additionally, each class has a unique type of gear associated with them that serves as a channel for the class's power.
This piece of gear is only attainable by leveling up and will provide bonuses to the class skill.

> An example of a class from the _Vale of Myths_ World Kit is given below.

### Knight

Knights are soldiers sworn to uphold the code of chivalry and defend the realm at all costs.
They are a stalwart force on the battlefield, often clad in heavy armor and weaponry and leading the charge against the enemy.
Knights fight for honor and glory, using their strength and martial prowess to defend the helpless from evil.

| Attribute | Skill     | Description                                                                    |
| --------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Strength  | **Honor** | Persuade others using morality and might, follow-up attack with a melee weapon |

Every Knight carries a Honorific Banner that bolsters their confidence and allows them to fight with Honor.
This piece of gear most often manifests itself as a physical banner with a meaningful coat of arms.
While this banner flies during battle, a Knight can use their second action to make a melee attack using Honor.

| Level | Honorific Banner Effect |
| ----- | ----------------------- |
| 1     | Honor +0                |
| 8     | Honor +1                |
| 16    | Honor +2                |
| 24    | Honor +3                |

Knights have access to perks built on top of the core commandments of chivalry.

| Attribute | Perk             | Requirement | Description                                                                                                                                       |
| --------- | ---------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Strength  | **Pledged Word** | Honor 1     | _Thou shalt never lie and shalt remain faithful to thy pledged word._ You get +2 to Speech when making a promise.                                 |
| Strength  | **Charge**       | Honor 2     | _Thou shalt not recoil before thine enemy._ Your movement speed is doubled for the first round of combat.                                         |
| Strength  | **Champion**     | Honor 2     | _Thou shalt be the champion of the good against evil._ Your initiative roll is automatically doubled.                                             |
| Strength  | **Bulwark**      | Honor 3     | _Thou shalt make war without cessation and without mercy._ You take only half damage when hit by an enemy with over half of its health remaining. |

## 2.5 Health Points

Each character has a number of health points, or HP, that measures their physical condition.
The Max HP for any character is equal to `(Level + Strength + Fortitude) x 6`.

> **Example:** A Level 5 character with Strength 4 and Fortitude 1 will have a Max HP of 60.

As a character engages in combat, they will take damage, lose HP, and face consequences (see [3.5 Death](#3.5-Death)).

## 2.6 Movement Speed

Each character has a movement speed that regulates how far they can move during combat.
Movement speed is measured in terms of grid tiles (most commonly 5 foot chunks).
A character's movement speed is equal to `(Dexterity + Movement) x 2`.

> **Example:** A character with Dexterity 3 and Movement 1 will have a movement speed of 8 tiles, or 40 feet.

Out of combat, all parties have the same movement speed of 10 miles per hour when traversing long distances.
This speed can be increased by vehicles provided in your chosen World Kit.

## 2.7 Carrying Capacity

Each character has a carrying capacity that determines how much gear and resources they can carry before becoming over-encumbered.
Carrying capacity is measured in terms of slots, an arbitrary unit of weight and size.
A character's carrying capacity is equal to `(Strength + Fortitude) x 2`.

> **Example:** A character with Strength 4 and Fortitude 1 will have a carrying capacity of 10 slots.

For simplicity, all items are divided into 7 size categories that correspond to a specific number of slots.

| Category       | Size      | Description           | _Vale of Myths_ Example | _Vega Matrix_ Example |
| -------------- | --------- | --------------------- | ----------------------- | --------------------- |
| **Tiny**       | 1/20 slot | Fits in a small bag   | Coin                    | Bullet                |
| **Very Light** | 1/4 slot  | Fits in a large bag   | Arrow, ration           | Ration                |
| **Light**      | 1/2 slot  | Fits in one hand      | Dagger                  | Pistol                |
| **Average**    | 1 slot    | Fits in two hands     | Sword                   | Rifle                 |
| **Heavy**      | 2 slots   | Heavy in two hands    | Greatsword              | Sniper rifle          |
| **Very Heavy** | 4 slots   | Fits on your shoulder | Cannon                  | Rocket launcher       |
| **Cumbersome** | 20 slots  | Fits on a vehicle     | Stone statue            | Scrap metal           |

When a character's carrying capacity is exceeded, they become over-encumbered and no longer have the strength to move themselves.

> All items that are carried count towards a character's carrying capacity.
> This does not include items that are worn, such as armor, clothing, and backpacks.

# 3. Adventuring

Once your campaign has a party of characters, there's only one thing left do: adventure!
Adventuring can take many shapes and forms, but _Vade Mecum_ provides a general rule set for how to resolve the adventuring day.

## 3.1 Skill Checks

When a character performs an action of consequence, the Game Master will ask for a skill check.
This includes the player rolling a number of dice based on the character's ability and the situational nature of the action.
Then based on the roll, the Game Master will resolve the outcome.

For any skill check, the player will roll a number of D6 equal to `(Attribute + Skill + Advantage - Disadvantage)`.

### Advantage and Disadvantage

While attribute and skill dice come directly from the character's innate ability, advantage/disadvantage comes from the objects or people involved in the action.

> For any skill check, the maximum advantage that can be applied is +6 and the maximum disadvantage is -6.

Most commonly, advantage will come from an item assisting the action, and disadvantage will come from an item countering the action.
Examples of common sources of advantage/disadvantage are given below.

| Skill     | Action                          | Advantage Source | Disadvantage Source |
| --------- | ------------------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------- |
| Power     | Melee attack                    | Weapon           | Armor, cover        |
| Precision | Pick a lock                     | Lock picking set | Lock                |
| Medicine  | Heal an incapacitated character | First aid kit    | Injury              |
| Speech    | Persuade an NPC                 | NPC              | NPC                 |

For ambiguous sources of advantage/disadvantage, such as locks, injuries, and NPC's, the Game Master can declare a difficulty.
There are 7 levels of difficulty, ranging from Trivial (+3) to Titan (-3).
In the examples below, we look at a Speech check where the Game Master may declare a difficulty based on the NPC.

| Difficulty    | A/D | Description                                  | Example            |
| ------------- | --- | -------------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| **Trivial**   | +3  | Extremely simple/likely                      | Your best friend   |
| **Very Easy** | +2  | Very simple/likely                           | Your friend        |
| **Easy**      | +1  | Somewhat simple/likely                       | A friendly NPC     |
| **Average**   | +0  | Not too simple or challenging, evenly likely | An indifferent NPC |
| **Hard**      | -1  | Somewhat challenging/unlikely                | A disgruntled NPC  |
| **Very Hard** | -2  | Very challenging/unlikely                    | Your enemy         |
| **Titan**     | -3  | Extremely challenging/unlikely               | Your nemesis       |

> **Example:** A character attempts to force open a locked door. The Game Master asks for a Power check.
> The character has Strength 4 and Power 2 and is using a Crowbar (+1) to assist them.
> The Game Master sets the door's difficulty at Very Hard (-2) since it is metal and reinforced.
> The player rolls a Power check with 5 D6.

### Success, Stalemate, and Failure

After a player rolls their dice, they can evaluate the outcome based on the highest die they rolled.
In the examples below, we look at a player rolling an Athletics check to scale a cliff.

| Max D6     | Result        | Outcome                                          | Example                                      |
| ---------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| 6          | **Success**   | The character completes the action successfully. | The character reaches the top of the cliff.  |
| 5          | **Stalemate** | The character is ineffectual in their attempt.   | The character is stuck on the ground.        |
| 4, 3, 2, 1 | **Failure**   | The character fails the action detrimentally.    | The character slips and falls off the cliff. |

In many situations, failure will mean the action can no longer be attempted by other members of the party.
For example, failing to force open a door may jam it closed, failing to pick a lock may ruin its keyhole, or failing to search a bookcase may ruin the books.

In this system, there is a strong relationship between the amount of dice being rolled and the chances of success and failure.
As such, _Vade Mecum_ encourages specialization from the party, rather than a brute force mentality.
There is a negative incentive to attempt difficult and dangerous situations, and a positive incentive to find solutions that play to the party's strengths.

> For example, if a Strength 1 character attempts a Power check to force open a door, there is a high chance they hurt themself, hurt someone else, or jam the door.
> But if a Strength 6 character attempts the same check, there is a high chance they succeed and a near zero chance they fail.

The exact probabilities for any roll is given below.

| # of Dice | Success | Stalemate | Failure |
| --------- | ------- | --------- | ------- |
| 1         | 16.7%   | 16.7%     | 66.7%   |
| 2         | 30.6%   | 25.0%     | 44.4%   |
| 3         | 42.1%   | 28.2%     | 29.6%   |
| 4         | 51.8%   | 28.5%     | 19.8%   |
| 5         | 59.8%   | 27.0%     | 13.2%   |
| 6         | 66.5%   | 24.7%     | 8.8%    |
| 7         | 72.1%   | 22.1%     | 5.9%    |
| 8         | 76.7%   | 19.4%     | 3.9%    |
| 9         | 80.6%   | 16.8%     | 2.6%    |
| 10        | 83.8%   | 14.4%     | 1.7%    |
| 11        | 86.5%   | 12.3%     | 1.2%    |
| 12        | 88.8%   | 10.4%     | 0.8%    |
| 13        | 90.7%   | 8.8%      | 0.5%    |
| 14        | 92.2%   | 7.4%      | 0.3%    |
| 15        | 93.5%   | 6.3%      | 0.2%    |

## 3.2 Weapons and Tools

To gain an edge on skill checks, characters can utilize weapons and tools that decrease the difficulty when performing specific actions.

> Individual weapons and tools are defined by the World Kit being used, but all of them follow a universal pattern for how they are defined.

Each item will specify its rarity (see [3.7 Cost and Currency](#3.7-Cost-and_Currency)), its size (see [2.7 Carrying Capacity](#2.7-Carrying-Capacity)), its difficulty modifier, and the skill action it applies to. Weapons, additionally, will specify the attack range and the amount of damage dealt.

> Some examples of weapon and tools from the _Vale of Myths_ World Kit is given below.

| Item                     | Rarity    | Size    | Modifier | Description                                    |
| ------------------------ | --------- | ------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Rope**                 | Common    | Average | +1       | Climbing with Athletics                        |
| **Sword**                | Average   | Average | +1       | Attacking with Power, 2d6 damage, 1 tile range |
| **Greatsword**           | Rare      | Heavy   | +2       | Attacking with Power, 4d6 damage, 1 tile range |
| **Ring of Invisibility** | Legendary | Tiny    | +6       | Sneaking with Stealth                          |

When using a piece of gear with durability, a failed skill check will result in the gear taking damage.
Damage results in the item's modifier decreasing by one.
When a gear's modifier falls below zero, it is considered broken and can no longer be used until it is repaired.
Repairs to restore the gear modifier can be made during a Rest (see [3.7 Rest](#3.7-Rest)).

## 3.3 Armor and Cover

Similar to how weapons decrease difficulty, armor and cover increases it.
There are three tiers of armor and cover that incrementally increase the difficulty of landing attacks.

| Tier       | Modifier | _Vale of Myths_ Armor Example | _Vale of Myths_ Cover Example |
| ---------- | -------- | ----------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| **Light**  | -1       | Leather armor                 | Foliage, fence                |
| **Medium** | -2       | Chainmail armor               | Tree, low wall                |
| **Heavy**  | -3       | Plate armor                   | Battlement                    |

> Protection given by armor and cover do stack when determining overall difficulty.
> For example, someone wearing medium armor behind medium cover would have a -4 difficulty modifier.
> General rules apply where an attack harder than Titan would automatically fail and thus cannot be rolled for.

While armor protects the wearer from melee and ranged attacks, cover only protects at range.
Additionally, those in cover cannot take Movement or Actions (see [3.4 Combat](#3.4-Combat)).

## 3.4 Combat

When a situation reaches a point than can no longer be resolved by words, the party enters combat.
Combat begins by determining each character's turn order by rolling for initiative. Each character
rolls a number of D6 equal to `(Dexterity + Perception)` and sums the roll to resolve their initiative.

> **Example:** A character with Dexterity 4 and Perception 2 rolls 6D6 and sums the value to 23.
> Characters with a higher initiative will go before them and characters with a lower initiative will go after.

Combat will persist for a number of rounds until one side concedes or parishes.
In every round of combat, each character will take a turn in order of initiative.
During their turn, a character can take Movement and up to two Actions (in any order or configuration).

> Each round of combat is roughly equivalent to 6 seconds of World time.

### Movement

Characters can utilize their movement speed to navigate the combat area and seek cover from the enemy.

| Type           | Description                                                       |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Move**       | Move a number of tiles up to your movement speed                  |
| **Take Cover** | Take cover behind an object by consuming half your movement speed |

### Action (2x)

Characters can use an action to perform a skill check or interact with objects in the combat area.
Of there two actions, a character can only use one to make an attack (unless otherwise specified by a perk or class.)

| Type                        | Example                                                                     |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Roll a Skill Check**      | Roll Power to make a melee attack, roll Investigation to search for an exit |
| **Interact with an Object** | Consume a potion, open a door, throw an object                              |

### Reaction

Additionally, characters can take one reaction per round that is prompted by the movement or action of another character.
By default, all characters can perform an opportunity attack as a reaction.

| Reaction               | Description                                                                                 |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Opportunity Attack** | When an enemy within 5 feet moves away from you, you can make an attack against that enemy. |

Classes and perks may give access to other available types of reactions.

### Surprise

In some cases, the party may attempt to surprise their enemy to gain an advantage.
To do this, one character from the party will roll a Stealth check with a difficulty modifier equivalent to the highest enemy Detection.

| Result        | Outcome                                                                             |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Success**   | The party surprises the enemy, earning a free round while the enemies are stunned.  |
| **Stalemate** | The party fails to surprise the enemy and begin combat as usual.                    |
| **Failure**   | The party prematurely alerts the enemy, giving them a free round for movement only. |

> **Example:** A party attempts to surprise a group of soldiers on patrol. The soldiers are led by a Scout with Detection 2.
> The character leading the party rolls a Stealth check with Very Hard (-2) difficulty and is successful.
> The party stuns the enemies and gets a free round against them.

## 3.5 Death

During combat, every character faces the possibility of death.
When a character's HP is reduced to 0, they are incapacitated and incur an injury.
There are six levels of injury with six degrees therein.

Immediately after being incapacitated, the player will roll a D6 to determine their character's injury level and another D6 to determine the injury degree.
A table of all injuries are given at the end of this section.

### Recoverable Injuries

If a character incurs an injury that is Minor (6), Moderate (5), or Serious (4), they will recover in a given number of rounds.
To accelerate their recovery, the injured player themself or another player within 1 tile can roll a Medicine check with the given difficulty.
If the roll is successful, the character is stabilized with 1 HP.

### Deadly Injuries

If a character incurs an injury that is Severe (3), Critical (2), or Fatal (1), they will die in a give number of rounds.
To prevent their death, another player within 1 tile must roll a Medicine check with the given difficulty.
If the roll is successful, the character is stabilized with 1 HP. Otherwise, the character is dead.

After a character is recovered from a deadly injury, they are disabled until their next Rest (see [3.7 Rest](#3.7-Rest)).
A disabled character has their movement speed reduced by half and cannot be healed by any means.

> While incapacitated, all attacks on the character are Trivial (+3) and increase the level of injury by one.

| D6  | Injury Level | Effect             | D6  | Injury Degree               | Difficulty     |
| --- | ------------ | ------------------ | --- | --------------------------- | -------------- |
| 6   | **Minor**    | Recovery, 2 rounds | 6   | **Whiplash**                | Very Easy (+2) |
| 6   | **Minor**    | Recovery, 2 rounds | 5   | **Cut skin**                | Easy (+1)      |
| 6   | **Minor**    | Recovery, 2 rounds | 4   | **Sprained ankle**          | Average        |
| 6   | **Minor**    | Recovery, 2 rounds | 3   | **Sprained wrist**          | Average        |
| 6   | **Minor**    | Recovery, 2 rounds | 2   | **Bruised rib**             | Hard (-1)      |

| 5   | **Moderate** | Recovery, 3 rounds | 6   | **Concussion**              | Easy (+1)      |
| 5   | **Moderate** | Recovery, 3 rounds | 5   | **Simple laceration**       | Easy (+1)      |
| 5   | **Moderate** | Recovery, 3 rounds | 4   | **Dislocated knee**         | Average        |
| 5   | **Moderate** | Recovery, 3 rounds | 3   | **Dislocated shoulder**     | Average        |
| 5   | **Moderate** | Recovery, 3 rounds | 2   | **Rib fracture**            | Hard (-1)      |
| 5   | **Moderate** | Recovery, 3 rounds | 1   | **Throat contusion**        | Hard (-1)      |
| 4   | **Serious**  | Recovery, 4 rounds | 6   | **Black eye**               | Easy (+1)      |
| 4   | **Serious**  | Recovery, 4 rounds | 5   | **Deep laceration**         | Easy (+1)      |
| 4   | **Serious**  | Recovery, 4 rounds | 4   | **Crushed leg**             | Average        |
| 4   | **Serious**  | Recovery, 4 rounds | 3   | **Crushed arm**             | Average        |
| 4   | **Serious**  | Recovery, 4 rounds | 2   | **Multiple rib fractures**  | Hard (-1)      |

## 3.7 Rest

After a day of adventuring, the party is required to rest for 8 hours to refresh their minds and bodies.
During these 8 hours, characters will engage in a mix of sleeping and a single light activity.
Any light activity permitted by the Game Master will be evaluated by a skill check.
The most common light activities are given below.

| Skill          | Light Activity                  | Success                                                   |
| -------------- | ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Detection**  | Keep watch for enemies.         | Forces the enemy's surprise attack to automatically fail. |
| **Medicine**   | Heal a character.               | Heals the character for a number of HP equal to the roll. |
| **Innovation** | Repair a damaged piece of gear. | Restores the gear's bonus by one.                         |

During this rest, all characters are expected to consume a meal ration.
Those that do will roll a number of D6 equal to `(Strength + Fortitude)` and heal that number of HP at the conclusion of the rest.

> If a rest is interrupted for more than 4 hours, it must be restarted.

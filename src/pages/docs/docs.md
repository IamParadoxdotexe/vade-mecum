# 1. World

The most important part of every RPG is its world. It's what gives the characters life and the adventures meaning.
By design, _Vade Mecum_ is world-agnostic, meaning it is built to work in any universe with any theme in any time period.

Does this mean we hang you out to dry when it comes to designing your World? Of course not!

_Vade Mecum_ provides a number of pre-built "World Kits" that will provide the resources you need to start adventuring.
This includes everything from weapons and armor, places and people, and adventuring classes.
We will highlight some of these kits below, but their complete documentation can be found in the kit itself.

# 2. Characters

A character is a sentient creature that exists in the World to work towards its goals, uphold its ideals, and above all else, survive.
Characters are chiefly defined by attributes, skills, and perks, all of which are deciding factors in just how well it performs at completing those objectives.

> Player characters, or PC's, are characters controlled by the players.
> Non-player characters, or NPC's, are characters controlled by the Game Master.

## 2.1 Attributes

Each character has 5 core attributes that define its physical and mental ability.
These attributes are scored on a scale from 1 to 6, with the average human being a 3.
When a character performs an action, these attribute scores are used to determine how well they do.

| Attribute        | Description                                              |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Strength**     | Measures athletics, endurance, and muscular power.       |
| **Dexterity**    | Measures agility, reflexes, and coordination.            |
| **Intelligence** | Measures critical thinking, problem solving, and memory. |
| **Charisma**     | Measures empathy, persuasiveness, and social influence.  |
| **Perception**   | Measures awareness, attention, and insightfulness.       |

Within the 5 attributes, each character has one Flaw and one Focus.
A character's Flaw is their glaring weakness—the quality that holds them back from being the perfect adventurer.
And oppositely, a character's Focus is their greatest power—the quality that makes them a master of their class.

## 2.2 Skills

Below attributes, characters have 15 core skills that represent proficiencies within a specific attribute area.
These skills are scored on a scale from 0 to 3, with the average human being a 1.
Skills allow characters to specialize themselves for specific types of actions.

| Attribute    | Skill             | Description                                                  |

## 2.3 Perks

From skills, characters can adopt perks that serve as an expansion of their overall abilities.
Each perk falls under a specific skill and will require a minimum level in that skill to acquire.
As such, perks give characters a way to accentuate their strengths in ways that compliment their play style.

## 2.4 Classes

While attributes, skills, and perks are the foundation of a character's abilities, classes are the foundation of a character's identity and nature.
Classes define a character's Focus attribute, as well as gives them access to skills, perks, and items that are otherwise inaccessible to other classes.

> Specific character classes are defined by the World Kit being used, but all classes follow a universal pattern for how they are structured.

Classes grant a character a unique 16th skill that falls under the designated Focus attribute.
This class skill is used to perform class-specific actions and give the character an edge in a specialized area of the World.

Each class provides a unique list of perks that fall under this class skill.
These class perks will often allow the character to evolve its abilities in different ways.

Additionally, each class has a unique type of gear associated with them that serves as a channel for the class's power.
This piece of gear is only attainable by leveling up and will provide bonuses to the class skill.

> An example of a class from the _Vale of Myths_ World Kit is given below.

### Knight

Knights are soldiers sworn to uphold the code of chivalry and defend the realm at all costs.
They are a stalwart force on the battlefield, often clad in heavy armor and weaponry and leading the charge against the enemy.
Knights fight for honor and glory, using their strength and martial prowess to defend the helpless from evil.

| Attribute | Skill     | Description                                                                    |
| --------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Strength  | **Honor** | Persuade others using morality and might, follow-up attack with a melee weapon |

Every Knight carries a Honorific Banner that bolsters their confidence and allows them to fight with Honor.
This piece of gear most often manifests itself as a physical banner with a meaningful coat of arms.
While this banner flies during battle, a Knight can use their second action to make a melee attack using Honor.

| Level | Honorific Banner Effect |
| ----- | ----------------------- |
| 1     | Honor +0,               |
| 8     | Honor +1                |
| 16    | Honor +2                |
| 24    | Honor +3                |

Knights have access to perks built on top of the core commandments of chivalry.

| Attribute | Perk             | Requirement | Description                                                                                                                                       |
| --------- | ---------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Strength  | **Pledged Word** | Honor 1     | _Thou shalt never lie and shalt remain faithful to thy pledged word._ You get +2 to Speech when making a promise.                                 |
| Strength  | **Charge**       | Honor 2     | _Thou shalt not recoil before thine enemy._ Your movement speed is doubled for the first round of combat.                                         |
| Strength  | **Champion**     | Honor 2     | _Thou shalt be the champion of the good against evil._ Your initiative roll is automatically doubled.                                             |
| Strength  | **Bulwark**      | Honor 3     | _Thou shalt make war without cessation and without mercy._ You take only half damage when hit by an enemy with over half of its health remaining. |

## 2.5 Health Points

Each character has a number of health points, or HP, that measures their physical condition.
The Max HP for any character is equal to `(Level + Strength + Fortitude) x 6`.

> **Example:** A Level 5 character with Strength 4 and Fortitude 1 will have a Max HP of 60.

As a character engages in combat, they will take damage, lose HP, and face consequences (see [3.5 Death](#3.5-Death)).

## 2.6 Movement Speed

Each character has a movement speed that regulates how far they can move during combat.
Movement speed is measured in terms of grid tiles (most commonly 5 foot chunks).
A character's movement speed is equal to `(Dexterity + Movement) x 2`.

> **Example:** A character with Dexterity 3 and Movement 1 will have a movement speed of 8 tiles, or 40 feet.

## 2.7 Carrying Capacity

Each character has a carrying capacity that determines how much gear and resources they can carry before becoming over-encumbered.
Carrying capacity is measured in terms of slots, an arbitrary unit of weight and size.
A character's carrying capacity is equal to `(Strength + Fortitude) x 2`.

> **Example:** A character with Strength 4 and Fortitude 1 will have a carrying capacity of 10 slots.

For simplicity, all items are divided into 7 size categories that correspond to a specific number of slots.

| Category       | Size      | Description           | _Vale of Myths_ Example | _Vega Matrix_ Example |
| -------------- | --------- | --------------------- | ----------------------- | --------------------- |
| **Tiny**       | 1/20 slot | Fits in a small bag   | Coin                    | Bullet                |
| **Very Light** | 1/4 slot  | Fits in a large bag   | Arrow, ration           | Ration                |
| **Light**      | 1/2 slot  | Fits in one hand      | Dagger                  | Pistol                |
| **Average**    | 1 slot    | Fits in two hands     | Sword                   | Rifle                 |
| **Heavy**      | 2 slots   | Heavy in two hands    | Greatsword              | Sniper rifle          |
| **Very Heavy** | 4 slots   | Fits on your shoulder | Cannon                  | Rocket launcher       |
| **Cumbersome** | 20 slots  | Fits on a vehicle     | Stone statue            | Scrap metal           |

When a character's carrying capacity is exceeded, they become over-encumbered and no longer have the strength to move themselves.

> All items that are carried count towards a character's carrying capacity.
> This does not include items that are worn, such as armor, clothing, and backpacks.

# 3. Adventuring

Once your campaign has a party of characters, there's only one thing left do: adventure!
Adventuring can take many shapes and forms, but _Vade Mecum_ provides a general rule set for how to resolve the adventuring day.

## 3.1 Skill Checks

When a character performs an action of consequence, the Game Master will ask for a skill check.
This includes the player rolling a number of dice based on the character's ability, any gear being used, and the situation itself.
Then based on the roll, the Game Master will resolve the outcome.

In this skill check, the player will roll a number of D6 equal to `(Attribute + Skill + Gear +/- Difficulty)`.

> **_Vega Matrix_ Example:** A character with Strength 4 and Power 2 wants to force open a locked door with a Crowbar (+1).
> The Game Master asks for the player to roll a Power check and sets the difficulty at Hard (-1).
> The players rolls 6 `(4 + 2 + 1 - 1)` D6.

There are 7 levels of difficulty that a check can be given, ranging from Trivial (+3) to Titan (-3).
In the examples below, we look at a player rolling a Speech check to persuade an NPC to help them.

| Difficulty    | Modifier | Description                                  | Example            |
| ------------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| **Trivial**   | +3       | Extremely simple/likely                      | Your best friend   |
| **Very Easy** | +2       | Very simple/likely                           | Your friend        |
| **Easy**      | +1       | Somewhat simple/likely                       | A friendly NPC     |
| **Average**   | +0       | Not too simple or challenging, evenly likely | An indifferent NPC |
| **Hard**      | -1       | Somewhat challenging/unlikely                | A disgruntled NPC  |
| **Very Hard** | -2       | Very challenging/unlikely                    | Your enemy         |
| **Titan**     | -3       | Extremely challenging/unlikely               | Your nemesis       |

> Actions that fall outside the bounds of these difficulties should not be given skill checks.
> An action harder than Titan would be an immediate failure and an action easier than Trivial would be an immediate success.

After a player rolls their dice, they can evaluate the outcome based on the highest die they rolled.
In the examples below, we look at a player rolling an Athletics check to scale a cliff.

| Max D6     | Result        | Outcome                                          | Example                                      |
| ---------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| 6          | **Success**   | The character completes the action successfully. | The character reaches the top of the cliff.  |
| 5          | **Stalemate** | The character is ineffectual in their attempt.   | The character is stuck on the ground.        |
| 4, 3, 2, 1 | **Failure**   | The character fails the action detrimentally.    | The character slips and falls off the cliff. |

In this system, there is a strong relationship between the amount of dice being rolled and the chances of success and failure.
As such, _Vade Mecum_ encourages specialization from the party, rather than a brute force mentality.
There is a negative incentive to attempt difficult and dangerous situations, and a positive incentive to find solutions that play to the party's strengths.

> For example, if a Strength 1 character attempts a Power check to force open a door, there is a high chance they hurt themself, hurt someone else, or jam the door.
> But if a Strength 6 character attempts the same check, there is a high chance they succeed and a near zero chance they fail.

The exact probabilities for any roll is given below.

| # of Dice | Success | Stalemate | Failure |
| --------- | ------- | --------- | ------- |
| 1         | 16.7%   | 16.7%     | 66.7%   |
| 2         | 30.6%   | 25.0%     | 44.4%   |
| 3         | 42.1%   | 28.2%     | 29.6%   |
| 4         | 51.8%   | 28.5%     | 19.8%   |
| 5         | 59.8%   | 27.0%     | 13.2%   |
| 6         | 66.5%   | 24.7%     | 8.8%    |
| 7         | 72.1%   | 22.1%     | 5.9%    |
| 8         | 76.7%   | 19.4%     | 3.9%    |
| 9         | 80.6%   | 16.8%     | 2.6%    |
| 10        | 83.8%   | 14.4%     | 1.7%    |
| 11        | 86.5%   | 12.3%     | 1.2%    |
| 12        | 88.8%   | 10.4%     | 0.8%    |
| 13        | 90.7%   | 8.8%      | 0.5%    |
| 14        | 92.2%   | 7.4%      | 0.3%    |
| 15        | 93.5%   | 6.3%      | 0.2%    |

## 3.2 Weapons and Tools

To gain an edge on skill checks, characters can utilize weapons and tools that increase the number of dice they can roll to perform specific actions.

> Individual weapons and tools are defined by the World Kit being used, but all of them follow a universal pattern for how they are defined.

Each item will specify its rarity (see [3.7 Cost and Currency](#3.7-Cost-and_Currency)), size (see [2.7 Carrying Capacity](#2.7-Carrying-Capacity)), associated skill, and gear bonus. Weapons, additionally, will specify an amount of damage that is dealt when an attack is successful.

> Some examples of weapon and tools from the _Vale of Myths_ World Kit is given below.

| Item                     | Rarity    | Size    | Skill       | Bonus | Damage |
| ------------------------ | --------- | ------- | ----------- | ----- | ------ |
| **Rope**                 | Common    | Average | **Agility** | +1    | /      |
| **Sword**                | Average   | Average | **Power**   | +1    | 2D6    |
| **Greatsword**           | Rare      | Heavy   | **Power**   | +2    | 3D6    |
| **Ring of Invisibility** | Legendary | Tiny    | **Stealth** | +5    | /      |

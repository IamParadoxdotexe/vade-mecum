# 1. World

The most important part of every RPG is its world. It's what gives the characters life and the adventures meaning.
By design, _Vade Mecum_ is world-agnostic, meaning it is built to work in any universe with any theme in any time period.

Does this mean we hang you out to dry when it comes to designing your World? Of course not!

_Vade Mecum_ provides a number of pre-built "World Kits" that will provide the resources you need to start adventuring.
This includes everything from weapons and armor, places and people, and adventuring classes.
We will highlight some of these kits below, but their complete documentation can be found in the kit itself.

## _Vale of Myths_ (High Fantasy)

# 2. Characters

A character is a sentient creature that exists in the World to work towards its goals, uphold its ideals, and above all else, survive.
Characters are chiefly defined by attributes, skills, and perks, all of which are deciding factors in just how well it performs at completing those objectives.

> Player characters, or PC's, are characters controlled by the players.
> Non-player characters, or NPC's, are characters controlled by the Game Master.

## 2.1 Attributes

Each character has 5 core attributes that define its physical and mental ability.
These attributes are scored on a scale from 1 to 6, with the average human being a 3.
When a character performs an action, these attribute scores are used to determine how well they do.

| Attribute    | Description                                              |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Strength     | Measures athletics, endurance, and muscular power.       |
| Dexterity    | Measures agility, reflexes, and coordination.            |
| Intelligence | Measures critical thinking, problem solving, and memory. |
| Charisma     | Measures empathy, persuasiveness, and social influence.  |
| Perception   | Measures awareness, attention, and insightfulness.       |

Within the 5 attributes, each character has one Flaw and one Focus.
A character's Flaw is their glaring weakness—the quality that holds them back from being the perfect adventurer.
And oppositely, a character's Focus is their greatest power—the quality that makes them a master of their class.

## 2.2 Skills

Below attributes, characters have 15 core skills that represent proficiencies within a specific attribute area.
These skills are scored on a scale from 0 to 3, with the average human being a 1.
Skills allow characters to specialize themselves for specific types of actions.

| Attribute    | Skill         | Description                                                  |

## 2.3 Perks

From skills, characters can adopt perks that serve as an expansion of their overall abilities.
Each perk falls under a specific skill and will require a minimum level in that skill to acquire.
As such, perks give characters a way to accentuate their strengths in ways that compliment their play style.

## 2.4 Classes

While attributes, skills, and perks are the foundation of a character's abilities, classes are the foundation of a character's identity and nature.
Classes define a character's Focus attribute, as well as gives them access to skills, perks, and items that are otherwise inaccessible to other classes.

> Specific character classes are defined by the World Kit being used, but all classes follow a universal pattern for how they are structured.

Classes grant a character a unique 16th skill that falls under the designated Focus attribute.
This class skill is used to perform class-specific actions and give the character an edge in a specialized area of the World.

Each class provides a unique list of perks that fall under this class skill.
These class perks will often allow the character to evolve its abilities in different ways.

Additionally, each class has a unique type of gear associated with them that serves as a channel for the class's power.
This piece of gear is only attainable by leveling up and will provide bonuses to the class skill.

> An example of a class from the _Vale of Myths_ World Kit is given below.

### Knight

Knights are soldiers sworn to uphold the code of chivalry and defend the realm at all costs.
They are a stalwart force on the battlefield, often clad in heavy armor and weaponry and leading the charge against the enemy.
Knights fight for honor and glory, using their strength and martial prowess to defend the helpless from evil.

| Attribute | Skill | Description                                                                    |
| --------- | ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Strength  | Honor | Persuade others using morality and might, follow-up attack with a melee weapon |

Every Knight carries a Honorific Banner that bolsters their confidence and allows them to fight with Honor.
This piece of gear most often manifests itself as a physical banner with a coat of arms.
While this banner flies during battle, a Knight can use their second action to make a follow-up attack using Honor after landing a melee attack using Force.

| Level | Honorific Banner Effect |

# 2. Characters

A character is a sentient creature that exists in the Game World to work towards its goals, uphold its ideals, and above all else, survive.
Characters are chiefly defined by attributes, skills, and perks, all of which are deciding factors in just how well it performs at completing those objectives.

> Player characters, or PC's, are characters controlled by the players.
> Non-player characters, or NPC's, are characters controlled by the Game Master.

## 2.1 Attributes

Each character has 5 core attributes that define its physical and mental ability.
These attributes are scored on a scale from 1 to 6, with the average human being a 3.
When a character performs an action, these attribute scores are used to determine how well they do.

| Attribute    | Description                                              |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Strength     | Measures athletics, endurance, and muscular power.       |
| Dexterity    | Measures agility, reflexes, and coordination.            |
| Intelligence | Measures critical thinking, problem solving, and memory. |
| Charisma     | Measures empathy, persuasiveness, and social influence.  |
| Perception   | Measures awareness, attention, and insightfulness.       |

Within the 5 attributes, each character has one "Flaw" and one "Focus".
A character's Flaw is their glaring weakness—the quality that holds them back from being the perfect adventurer.
Oppositely, a character's Focus is their greatest power—the quality that makes them a master of their class.

## 2.2 Skills

Below attributes, characters have 15 core skills that represent proficiencies within a specific attribute area.
These skills are scored on a scale from 0 to 3, with the average human being a 1.
Skills allow characters to specialize themselves for specific types of actions.

| Attribute    | Skill         | Description                                                  |

## 2.3 Perks

From skills, characters can adopt perks that serve as an expansion of their overall abilities.
Each perk falls under a specific skill and will require a minimum level in that skill to acquire.
As such, perks give characters a way to accentuate their strengths in ways that compliment their play style.

> Most perks augment the ways characters adventure, so we recommend revisiting the list below once you are familiar with the adventuring mechanics.
